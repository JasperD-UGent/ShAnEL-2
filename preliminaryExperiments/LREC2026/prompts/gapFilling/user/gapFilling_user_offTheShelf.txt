Exercise to be corrected:
{{
    "exercise_instruction": "{instruction}",
    "exercise_item": "{target_sentence}",
    "response": {response},
    "example_solution": {example_solution}
}}

-----

Observations to be taken into account when correcting the exercise:
- "response" corresponds to what the student filled in for '<gap>' in "exercise_item".
- If "response" is grammatically correct and adheres to "exercise_instruction", assign True as the value for "correct" and None as the value for "corrected_response" in the requested JSON blob.
- If "response" is grammatically incorrect and/or does not adhere to "exercise_instruction", assign False as the value for "correct" and assign a corrected version of "response" as the value for "corrected_response" in the requested JSON blob.
- The example solution represents a correct answer, but be aware that this is not necessarily the only correct solution.
