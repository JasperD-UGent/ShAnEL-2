# 6. The Conditional

Conditionals basically occur in **hypothetical environments**. The proposition in the main clause is linked up with a hypothesis in the subclause, often an if-clause. Conditional forms have been described in terms of the FULFILMENT of the conditions stated, which results in a basic three-way division:
- (1) If X is the case, then Y will happen.
	- was the case, then Y would happen.
	- had been the case, then Y would have happened.
- (1') If X SIMPLE PRESENT, Y WILL + INFINITIVE
	- SIMPLE PAST, Y WOULD + INFINITIVE
	- PAST PERFECT Y WOULD + HAVE+ PAST PARTICIPLE

| type 1 | type 2 | type 2 | type 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NON-PAST | NON-PAST | NON-PAST | PAST |
| PROBABLE | LESS PROBABLE (but POSSIBLE in the HYPOTHETICAL WORLD) | IMPROBABLE (but POSSIBLE in the HYPOTHETICAL WORLD) | IMPOSSIBLE |

**Note:**
Sometimes the if-clause is understood, as in (2):
- (2) Would you have told us? (i.e. if we had asked you)
	- cf. Zou jij het ons hebben verteld? (d.w.z. als ...)

## 6.1 Probable Fulfilment

A type 1 conditional sentence refers to NON-PAST time. The condition is sometimes described as **open** or **real**, which means that its fulfilment is (more or less) probable. What is said in the main clause depends on something that may or may not happen, though this 'something' is assumed by the speaker to be really possible, probable or even likely.
- (3) If you <u>ask</u> him (now/tomorrow) (a), he <u>will help</u> you (b).
- (4) If I <u>can</u> make it there (a), I<u>'ll make</u> it anywhere (b). (Frank Sinatra)

The same basic type is used when the conjunction *unless* introduces the conditional subclause:
- (5) <u>I'll stay</u> at home unless I <u>get</u> an invitation.
	- (= **if** I do**n't** get an invitation)
	- cf. Ik blijf thuis tenzij ik een uitnodiging krijg.
- (6) Your life <u>won't change</u>, unless you <u>change</u> it.

**Note:**
*Will* with pure future reference does not occur in the subclause of type 1 conditionals. However, see 6.4.1 for modal uses.
- (7) \*If the weather will be good tomorrow, we'll have a picnic.
