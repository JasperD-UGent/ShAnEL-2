# 10. Modal Auxiliaries

We will examine what these modal auxiliaries (or 'modals') do to the meaning of the sentence (or clause) and how they can be translated into Dutch. In doing so, we will proceed as follows:

1.  We will adopt a set of **BASIC MEANINGS** (IN CAPITALS) and offer near-equivalent **Dutch translations**. Thus, **CAN** carries ABILITY, PERMISSION, POSSIBILITY and is basically translated as *kunnen*.
2.  At the same time, **pragmatic meanings** will be considered. The problem with pragmatic meanings, such as "request", is that they involve rather complex "speech acts" which cannot be pinned down on the BASIC MEANINGS of modals alone. "Request" in *Can you do this for me?*, for example, combines the BASIC MEANING of ABILITY with Questioning, which means that it **requires a specific situation**.

But there is more to it. The same "request" can be realized in **many alternative ways**, such as: *Give me a hand*, *Please*, etc. Besides, the very utterance *Can you do this for me?* itself can have **many different pragmatic meanings in different situations**, ranging from *That would be nice of you* to *Make it snappy!*, or *I don't accept 'no' for an answer*.

Consequently, it is impossible to list **all** these "pragmatic situations" including **all** the possible ways of expressing modality accordingly. Hence our decision to start off with a traditional formal description of the modal auxiliaries, which will be expanded with "alternatives" and "pragmatic meanings".

3. For all these reasons, alternative **non-modal and even non-verbal** equivalents will also be referred to.
4. Furthermore, we will constantly underpin our formal approach by referring to three sets of important notions:
	- TIME (PAST versus NON-PAST) and TENSE
	- ASSERTIVE (POS) versus NON-ASSERTIVE (NEG and Q)
	- STATE versus EVENT

THE PRESENT-TENSE FORM
- POS, NEG, Q (if the distinction is relevant)
- Specific Expressions of the FUTURE (if relevant)
- 'Pragmatic Meanings' of the MODAL under discussion
