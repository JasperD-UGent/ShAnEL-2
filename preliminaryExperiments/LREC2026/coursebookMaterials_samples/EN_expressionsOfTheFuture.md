# 5. Expressions of the Future

*Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift. That's why we call it the present.*

## 5.1 Introduction

In general, future events are 'uncertain'. Hence, we normally refer to them as probabilities, plans, intentions, predictions or educated guesses, etc. rather than as certain facts. However, people have different ways of looking at future events about which they may entertain different degrees of certainty. These different ways are reflected in different expressions of future time, as will be discussed below.

Expressing the future, however, is not only a matter of tense use, but also of textual (and situational) context. One and the same form can have two different meanings depending on the discourse, which will normally disambiguate the sentence:
- (1) Hey, what <u>are</u> you <u>singing</u>? It sounds familiar but I can't put my finger on it. => PRES
	- cf. Wat <u>ben</u> je <u>aan het zingen</u>? Het klinkt vertrouwd in de oren, maar ik kan het niet thuisbrengen.
- (1') It's your first gig tonight. What <u>are</u> you <u>singing</u>? => FUT
		- cf. Vanavond je eerste optreden. Wat <u>zing</u> je?

The most explicit FUTURE TIME markers are *time adverbials*: adverbs, prepositional phrases and clauses of time, cf.
- (2) Tomorrow I <u>shall be</u> twenty.
	- cf. Morgen <u>word</u> ik twintig.
- (3) The train <u>leaves</u> at 6.30.
	- cf. De trein <u>vertrekt</u> om 6u30.
- (4) When they arrive, I <u>will be checking</u> in.
	- cf. Wanneer zij aankomen, <u>zal</u> ik <u>aan het inchecken zijn</u>.

Note also that the Dutch equivalent need not be the same verb form, as in (2) (see also below). Sentences (1) – (4) also illustrate some of the variety of verb forms that can refer to the future. The table below offers a more complete survey of forms, which will be discussed in more detail in the next sections.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 5.2-3 | <ul><li>**WILL/SHALL + infinitive** (*He will leave early.*)</li><li>**WILL/SHALL + perf. infinitive** (*He will have left by then.*)</li></ul> |
| 5.4-5 | <ul><li>**WILL/SHALL + prog. infinitive** (*He will be leaving early again, I think.*)</li><li>**WILL/SHALL + perf. prog. infinitive** (*He will have been teaching for ten years by then.*)</li></ul> |

## 5.2 Will/shall + Infinitive (= Future Simple)

### 5.2.1 Form

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person | <ul><li>I/we will (BrE, neutral; AmE)</li><li>I/we shall (BrE, neutral/more formal)</li></ul> | |
| 2nd person | you will | + bare infinitive |
| 3rd person | he/she/it/they will | |

- Positive form: frequently contracted to: 'll
- Negative form: will not/won't – shall not/shan't
- Interrogative form
	- will/shall I
	- will you
	- will he/she/it

The form *'ll* is not possible when the infinitive is ellipted, though *won't* and *shan't* are:
- (5) Who'll win this year's Champions League?
	- They <u>won't</u>, that's for sure.
	- They <u>will</u> (\*They'll), that's for sure.

**Notes:**
1) *Shall/will* is not used in temporal subclauses (with *when*, *once*, *until*, *before*, etc.)
	- You'll understand, once you (\*<u>will</u>) <u>have reached</u> maturity.
	- When she (\*<u>will arrive</u>) <u>arrives</u> and sees the surprise, I'm sure she'll cry.
2) Auxiliary *will* is only used in temporal subclauses when they express a situation that thespeaker thinks is **unreal**:
	- He'd rather shoot himself before he<u>'ll share</u> classified information.
